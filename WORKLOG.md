### 5/23

Researched spectrogram and wav files, did some digging and found a sample wav > spectrogram program on StackOverflow

### 5/24

Deleted old program since we decided on a new idea. Made a program that extracts data bytes from a WAV file and puts it in an unsigned char (byte) array.

### 5/25-5/27

Wrote functions to insert and extract a string into/out of a WAV file's least significant bytes. Basically did our Processing image encoder and decoder but with WAV bytes instead of PNG bytes.
